# Restaurant-Customer-Sentiment-Analysis
A webscraper and predictive model were created to analyze Yelp reviews on all Thai restaurants in NYC for business insights. This project was created as part of my Springboard Capstone project. 

In this repository, you will find the data set representing meta-data and review data collected from all Thai restaurants in NYC, in addition to the code used to scrape the data and develop predictive models. This code is stored in several ipython notebooks that include the webscraper and the text classifying algorithms tested.
